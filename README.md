# Python 3 Snippets
This is a repository of Python 3 files that generate, model or facilitate very specific *things*.

There is zero licensing attached to any of these "snippets", but credit is appreciated if you feel this has helped you.
If you wish to credit me, please copy this next line, replacing the filenames with a Pythonic list of filenames used.
Anybody can use any portion of this code, for any reason; *forever*.

Each file housed here can be run as a standalone program. They will more or less "explain themselves" in the CLI or IDLE.
The entire point of these files, is to represent a "theoretically correct" way of doing things; not necessarily Pythonic.
Although some may seem inconsequential, these files have been given lots of thought on what they actually accomplish.
I've done my best to include detailed Docstrings throughout every file, to more easily explain what's happening.

Stay Gold.
