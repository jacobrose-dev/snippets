# Python 3 Snippets
This is a repository of Python 3 files that generate, model or facilitate very specific *things*.
* Anybody can use any portion of this code, for any reason; *forever*.

There is zero licensing attached to any of these "snippets", but credit is appreciated if you feel this has helped you.
If you wish to credit me, please copy this next line, replacing the filenames with a Pythonic list of filenames used.

Each file housed here can be run as a standalone program, and will more or less explain itself as it executes statements.
These files have been given lots of thought on what they actually accomplish, although some may seem inconsequential.

I've done my best to explain what each function in every file does
