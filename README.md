# Python 3 Gems
This is a repository for Python 3 code that facilitates very specific functionalities.

Each file housed here can be run as a standalone program, and will more or less explain itself as it executes statements.
These files have been given lots of thought on what they actually accomplish, although some may seem inconsequential.

* Anybody can use any portion of this code, for any reason; *forever*.
